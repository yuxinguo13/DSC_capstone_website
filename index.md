**RoBERTa Embedding:** For deep textual understanding, we leverage RoBERTa embeddings, enriching our analysis with nuanced language representation.

**Graph Construction:** We architect a directed graph where nodes symbolize individual comments, and edges reflect the direct interactions, forming the backbone of our analysis.

**GAT Implementation:** Utilizing TensorFlow, our GAT model dynamically assigns weights to node interactions, facilitating nuanced sentiment classification.
