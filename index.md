**RoBERTa Embedding:** For deep textual understanding, we leverage RoBERTa embeddings, enriching our analysis with nuanced language representation.

**Graph Construction:** We architect a directed graph where nodes symbolize individual comments, and edges reflect the direct interactions, forming the backbone of our analysis.

**GAT Implementation:** Utilizing TensorFlow, our GAT model dynamically assigns weights to node interactions, facilitating nuanced sentiment classification.

The integration of GNN with RoBERTa resulted in a substantial accuracy improvement, confirming the model's efficacy in capturing complex relational dynamics and enhancing sentiment analysis.

Our findings reveal the GAT-enhanced model's superior performance in sentiment analysis over conventional methods. This advancement is especially pronounced in deciphering the layered interactions of social media, highlighting the critical role of relational data.

## Discussion

Integrating GNNs with NLP technologies heralds a new era in sentiment analysis, enriching our comprehension of text-based emotions and social interconnections. This methodology not only deciphers individual sentiments but also maps out the relational dynamics pervading text data, marking a significant stride in digital communication analysis.

This investigation underscores the synergy between GNNs and NLP in dissecting digital communications' complexities. Our approach sheds light on the nuanced world of online sentiments, offering a groundbreaking perspective on analyzing intricate text data.
